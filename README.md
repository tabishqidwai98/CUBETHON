# CUBETHON
I have coded, desgined theis app with unity and VS, and also included builds to it. This game is coded in C# using Unity libraies and is performing good on all parts.

This game has four levels, designed to play, and quits when button is pressed. All levels are desgined to the persepective that player can esialy play it.


It is windowed app which means you cannot change the size of the window.
